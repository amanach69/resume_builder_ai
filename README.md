This point fits well in the **Limitations** section since it highlights a trade-off between cost and performance. Here's the updated section:

---

## üìå Limitations  

- Optimized for AI/ML job roles. Performance may vary for other fields.  
- LLM results depend on the quality and clarity of job descriptions and resumes provided.  
- **Model Performance vs. Cost:** Based on usage, OpenAI models generally produce better results compared to open-source models. However, using OpenAI models incurs costs, making them less ideal for users seeking a completely free solution.

---

## üí° Future Improvements  

- Extend support to other fields beyond AI and ML.  
- Add more resume templates and customization options.  
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning LLMs.
